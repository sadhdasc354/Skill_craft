Problem Statement

We aggregated screen movements into screen-fixations using a Salvucci & Goldberg (2000) dispersion-threshold algorithm, and defined Perception Action Cycles (PACs) as fixations with at least one action.

--Time is recorded in terms of timestamps in the StarCraft 2 replay file. When the game is played on 'faster', 1 real-time second is equivalent to roughly 88.5 timestamps.

--List of possible game actions is discussed in Thompson, Blair, Chen, & Henrey (2013)

Solution

Complete univariate analysis and bivariate analysis and Completed with a small trick Converted the target variable from continous variable into logical variable(0,1)

0 means do not possess Perception Action Cycles

1 means possess Perception Action Cycles
